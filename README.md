# Portfolio-Website

This application was created as a profesional resource when paired alongside my CV and Cover Letter.

The website includes multi-page functionality, a responsive and dynamic design, a contact form and the use of the GitHub API to import my personal profile, along with Javascript for styling and design.

The website allowed me to really experiment with styling and using external API's for the first time. It also gave me to centralize all of my project and gave me a reason to develop the content contained within my GitHub, while also creating a LinkedIn account.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML, CSS, SASS, GIT, Bootstrap, Javascript and GitHub API.
